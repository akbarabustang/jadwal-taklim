## üèó Architecture

### Technology Stack

**Backend:**
- Laravel 12 (PHP 8.2+)
- MySQL/SQLite database
- Eloquent ORM for database interactions

**Frontend:**
- Inertia.js for SPA-like experience with server-side routing
- Vue 3 (Composition API)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vite for asset bundling

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Monolithic Architecture**: Single Laravel application serving both frontend and backend
- **Inertia.js**: Chosen for seamless integration between Laravel and Vue without building a separate API
- **Server-Side Rendering**: SEO-friendly with Inertia.js SSR support
- **Component-Based Frontend**: Reusable Vue components for maintainability

### Database Schema

**Main Tables:**

1. **taklim_schedules**
   - Core table storing all schedule information
   - Includes schedule details, location, timing, and metadata
   - Fields: id, title, description, ustad_name, mosque_name, mosque_address, mosque_city, schedule_date, start_time, end_time, frequency, category, is_active, contact_person, contact_number, timestamps

2. **users** (Laravel default)
   - Used for admin authentication in Phase 2

**Future Tables (Phase 2):**
- mosques (separate mosque management)
- ustadz/speakers (dedicated ustadz profiles)
- categories (dynamic category management)
- activity_logs (admin action tracking)

### Key Models & Scopes

**TaklimSchedule Model:**
- `scopeUpcoming()` - Fetch future active schedules ordered by date
- `scopeActive()` - Fetch only active schedules
- Accessors: `formatted_date`, `time_range`

## üé® Design System

### Color Palette

**Primary Colors:**
- Orange (#f97316): Warm, inviting, used for primary actions and highlights
- Green (#059669): Islamic theme, peaceful, used for secondary elements
- White (#FFFFFF): Clean backgrounds

**Usage Guidelines:**
- Primary orange for CTAs, links, and important UI elements
- Secondary green for success states, secondary actions
- Gradient combinations for hero sections and feature highlights

### Typography
- Default: System font stack with Figtree as primary font
- Headings: Bold weights for clear hierarchy
- Body: Regular weight for readability

### Component Patterns
- Card-based layouts for schedule items
- Table view for detailed schedule listing
- Filters with real-time search debouncing
- Responsive navigation with mobile menu

## üîí Security Considerations

### Current (Phase 1):
- No authentication required for public pages
- XSS protection via Vue's automatic escaping
- CSRF protection on forms (Laravel default)

### Future (Phase 2):
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Secure password storage with bcrypt
- Activity logging for audit trails

## üöÄ Deployment Considerations

### Server Requirements:
- PHP 8.2 or higher
- MySQL 8.0+ or SQLite
- Node.js 20.x for asset compilation
- Composer for dependency management

### Environment Variables:
- `APP_NAME`: Application name
- `APP_ENV`: Environment (local, production)
- `APP_URL`: Application URL
- `DB_*`: Database configuration
- `VITE_*`: Frontend configuration

### Production Checklist:
- [ ] Enable caching (config, routes, views)
- [ ] Set `APP_DEBUG=false`
- [ ] Configure proper database credentials
- [ ] Set up SSL/HTTPS
- [ ] Configure mail driver for notifications (Phase 2)
- [ ] Set up backup strategy
- [ ] Configure queue driver for async jobs (Phase 2)

## üìä Performance Optimization

### Database:
- Indexed columns: schedule_date, is_active, category, mosque_city
- Eager loading relationships to avoid N+1 queries
- Query result caching for frequently accessed data

### Frontend:
- Lazy loading for route components
- Image optimization
- CSS/JS minification in production
- Debounced search inputs

### Future Enhancements:
- Redis cache for schedule data
- Queue jobs for heavy operations
- CDN for static assets
